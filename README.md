# Csharp-advance-programming-dsa
This repository contains C# programs focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), organized branch-wise for systematic learning.
The goal of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and efficient data handling in C# through hands-on practice.

## 📂 Branch Structure

### 🔹 `sorting` branch
This branch focuses on Sorting Algorithms in C#, covering both basic and advanced sorting techniques.
The problems are designed using real-world scenarios (students, employees, products, salaries) to help understand algorithm logic, time complexity, and data organization in a practical way.
All sorting programs are implemented from scratch to strengthen DSA fundamentals.

### 📝 Practice Problems

- **Bubble Sort – Sort Student Marks**  
  Implement Bubble Sort to arrange student marks in ascending order by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements.

- **Insertion Sort – Sort Employee IDs**  
  Use Insertion Sort to sort employee IDs by inserting elements into their correct position in a growing sorted portion of the array.

- **Merge Sort – Sort Book Prices**  
  Apply Merge Sort to sort book prices by dividing the array recursively and merging sorted subarrays.

- **Quick Sort – Sort Product Prices**  
  Implement Quick Sort using a pivot-based partitioning approach to efficiently sort product prices.

- **Selection Sort – Sort Exam Scores**  
  Use Selection Sort to repeatedly select the minimum element and place it in its correct position.

- **Heap Sort – Sort Job Applicants by Salary**  
  Build a Max Heap and repeatedly extract the maximum element to sort salary demands in ascending order.

- **Counting Sort – Sort Student Ages**  
  Implement Counting Sort to sort student ages efficiently when the input range is small and known.
